UnDAW uses the metasound builder subsystem, the harmonix plugin and a bunch of custom widgets to create dynamic metasounds that can play midi files in just a few clicks, it lets you assign different metasound patches to each midi track, edit the midi in real time, and few other conveniences. 

UnDAW is a work in progress, there are many features included in the repo that just don't work, either because they were never finished or because I didn't maintain them.
